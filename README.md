# DKB Credit Card Scraper

![https://github.com/seiferma/io.github.seiferma.jameica.hibiscus.dkb.creditcard/actions/workflows/maven.yml](https://github.com/seiferma/io.github.seiferma.jameica.hibiscus.dkb.creditcard/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

This plugin integrates the credit card information of DKB into Hibiscus. Hibiscus is a home banking application that mainly supports HBCI. DKB, however, does not offer access to credit card transactions via standard HBCI protocol. This plugin uses the website to gather this information.

For detailed information about the plugin and how to use it, please refer to the [corresponding documentation page](https://seiferma.github.io/io.github.seiferma.jameica.hibiscus.dkb.creditcard).
